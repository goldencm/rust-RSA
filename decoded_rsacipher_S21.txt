CIS 475 Introduction to Cryptography. Assignment 3 (Spring 2021) If you have come this far then you know how RSA works. For this assignment, you have to submit two files. The first file is this decrypted file. For the second file: provide your own implementation of the RSA crypto system in any programming language of your choice. Allow the user a freedom to choose the bit-length for their prime numbers. Your system should encrypt only single ASCII characters from text files without salting. Your program should take four input parameters: a plaintext filename, a cipher text filename, and a filename for the decrypted text, and a bit-length parameter. The cipher text should be an ASCII file that is a sequence of numbers separated by newlines. So what to submit: you have to encrypt this file using your own implementation of RSA and send me the decrypted file along with the RSA modulus and the secret exponent required to decrypt the file so I can decrypt it properly. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask me. RSA assignment is due April 6th midnight.
